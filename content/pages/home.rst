Dulwich is a Python implementation of the Git file formats and protocols, which does not depend on Git itself.

All functionality is available in pure Python. Optional C extensions can be built for improved performance.

Dulwich takes its name from the area in London where the friendly `Mr. and Mrs. Git <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtyO4tmpPdk>`_ once attended a cocktail party.

Supported Python versions are 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.
