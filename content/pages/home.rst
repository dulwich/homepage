Dulwich is a Python implementation of the Git file formats and protocols, which does not depend on Git itself.

All functionality is available in pure Python. Optional C extensions can be built for improved performance.

Dulwich takes its name from the area in London where the friendly Mr. and Mrs. Git once attended a cocktail party.

Supported Python versions are Python 3.5 and later. Versions of Dulwich prior
to 0.20 also supported Python 2.7. Supported platforms include Linux, Mac OS X
and Windows.
